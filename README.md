Simple test of Sentryâ€™s Cocoa SDK in Swift environment

## Sentry E-Commerce Sample App

This repository contains a minimal SwiftUI iOS application demonstrating Sentry error monitoring, performance tracing, profiling and mobile session replay. The app loads a catalog with an intentional delay, lets users add items to a cart, and triggers an error on checkout to showcase Sentry's reporting.

Open `SentryECommerceSampleApp.swift` to configure your DSN and launch the app.
